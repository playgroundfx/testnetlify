# Chainstack partners with DApps Dev Club

 _Chainstack partners with DApps Dev Club_

DApps Dev Club is excited to announce that we will be partnering with
[Chainstack][15]. Chainstack has kindly offered us a venue to host our
sessions once per month - so every _alternate_ DApps Dev Club session
will be held at their space, starting with [our next session][16].

![Chainstack logo][17]

Let's hear about it from [Ashlie Chin][18], who is a product marketer at
Chainstack.

**Brendan** : Hi Ashlie! Before we start, I'd like to say a big thanks
from Kenneth and myself for offering to host our sessions at your
offices. It has been quite the tough journey for us sourcing for venue
partners - finding a once-off venue is hard enough, and finding a
recurring one has been a most daunting task. So you coming through is
somewhat akin to the light at the end of the tunnel!

**Ashlie** : Not a problem! I think it's great what you guys are doing,
and we're happy we can help.

**Brendan** : And of course, much thanks on behalf of all the people
attending our sessions. A few have asked me in person, as well as DM'ing
me on [our discord][10] about when the next session will be. Each time
I've had to tell them that we don't have one confirmed yet, because of
the venue. So they're going to be quite happy to hear this [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/)!

**Ashlie** : _AWH!_ Yeah, I feel the same when I'm waiting for a bus and
I can't check when the next bus is on the bus app because my phone is
dead. I'm so used to being comfortable with knowing what to expect. When
is it going to come? Is it ever going to come? Not the same situation?
OK.

**Brendan** : OK let's talk a little about yourself, and then about
Chainstack. I noticed from your email that you speak Spanish; and from
your blog that you've received a thank you letter from the Japanese
ambassador; and now you're doing product marketing for a software
company. What's the story there?

**Ashlie** : Oh, well I had to learn Spanish as a course requirement.
But I had the opportunity to spend a summer in Mexico last year, and I
spent 2 months of that traveling on my own. A lot of my proficiency came
from trying to speak to my Uber drivers, or people that sat next to me
on buses. It was a lot of fun, and just for the record, Mexico is my
favourite country. I don't know [how to](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-trading-how-to/) say [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) in Spanish though
- just kidding - [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) in spanish is just [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/).

**Brendan** : Google translate tells me "bloque encadenado" \- I would
have been fooled!

**Ashlie** : With regards to the thank you letter from the Japanese
ambassador… this is a story from a pretty long time ago. When I was 15 I
started a project to collect socks (there is a reason why socks
specifically) for some of the victims of the Tohoku earthquake and
tsunami, and I had approached some companies to help out with the
freight. I never really thought much about it, because I couldn't do
anything big for bureaucracy reasons and left it as a very informal
effort. They ended up putting that story on the [news](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/forex-news-website/)paper and I guess
the Japanese embassy read about it.

**Brendan** : That is a really awesome story - I wish I was that
switched on at that age! You can read [the full story][19] on Ashlie's
blog. It is also a story about big an impact a teacher can make on a
student, and I enjoyed reading it very much. Let's next talk about what
brought you to Chainstack.

**Ashlie** : I've don't really have a long, overarching story that has
led up to me being in this space, but what I can say is that I enjoy
being in situations that seem completely foreign or ambiguous to me, and
the challenge that comes along with it. Which is why I'm generally quite
fond of working in startups, that I have had some experience with. In
2017 I also spent 6 months working in a FinTech startup in Tel-Aviv. The
company focused on democratizing access to financial services by
providing online remittance services to migrant workers. I always enjoy
the learning and exposure that comes along with being in this type of
environment - I like being exposed to new solutions that solve real
problems and have real, tangible, impact on people.

Also, being in an environment that values leaning is extremely important
to me, because at the end of the day, if you can learn anything, you can
do anything (…eventually!) I also have a tattoo that reminds me to
always make mistakes. Not that the tattoo was a mistake, but it's a
representation and a reminder that I should never let the fear of
failing stop me from doing something. Also, making mistakes are the best
way to learn.

I had initially applied for a product designer role when I first came
across Chainstack's profile, but they thought I made a better fit as
product marketer. I felt that one valuable thing that UX provided was a
framework that put your users at the center of design, which at the end
of the day is relevant in many [functions](https://www.fintechee.com/tutorial-for-forex-trading/basic-functions/), including product marketing.
Blockchain is interesting in this aspect because it's still a relatively
new technology, and many people are still trying to figure out [how to](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-trading-how-to/)
integrate it into the existing ways that we do things today, like trying
to make application interfaces user-friendly, and understanding [how to](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/forex-trading-how-to/)
communicate its value effectively.

**Brendan** : Well you are off to a terrific start, I have to say, with
product marketing. Your setting this up is certainly going to get
Chainstack, and therefore its product, a lot of exposure amongst the dev
community here.

**Ashlie** : Long story short, Chainstack has a really great, passionate
team, and we're doing some amazing, cutting-edge work that could create
some very practical and valuable impact, so that sold me. I think it was
also a great space to be in. The people here are extremely knowledgeable
and amazing at what they do, and they're always willing to answer all my
dumb questions. I'm essentially feeding off everybody's genius-ness
here, it's great.

**Brendan** : Yeah. What stands out to me, from what you've just said,
is that the mission is to apply this particular new technology to solve
real world problems. Thinking in broader strokes, it isn't _only_
technology for technology's sake, but getting it to be used in a
practical way by real people. That is something I'd certainly like to
see a lot more of in this space myself!

**Ashlie** : I completely agree! I'm personally very new to the
[blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) space, and it's been a lot - Incredible, but a lot. Though
what I really love about it is that everyone's extremely willing to
engage with you and share their experience. You also get to meet a lot
of extremely passionate people, which are personally some of my
favourite people to be around. There's also a lot of effort for
community engagement which is extremely encouraging to see.

What I've found to be really interesting also is the broad range of
people interested in DLT, just because it crosses so many different
themes (governance, economics, political philosophy, etc) and it also
has so much transformative potential. You can't look at technology in a
vacuum, and [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) is one of them that can have massive implications
on many existing structures and today.

**Brendan** : I know the feeling, you can really geek out about
everything that involves applying a set of rules to a large number of
people participating in a system. It's fun to geek out about how one
would reinvent concepts that we have grown up taking for granted as
being set in stone. Everything from Athenian democracy, to the Magna
Carta, to the stock market, can be reimagined and implemented
independent of the control of a nation state. This is very powerful
stuff at our fingertips - you just need to be able to express it in
code! But I'm going to stop there, and get back on topic …

**Ashlie** : … so Chainstack.

**Brendan** : Yup. Before we get into Chainstack, when Kenneth and I
visited your offices, we saw that you're located within Acronis'
offices. What's the link between Acronis and Chainstack?

**Ashlie** : Chainstack is a spin-off start up from Acronis, a leading
backup software, disaster recovery, and secure data access provider to
consumers, small-medium businesses, and enterprises. Both the co-
founders, [Laurent Dedenis][20] and [Eugene Aseev][21] were working on
[blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) projects during their time there. So they're familiar with
exactly what it's like trying to work with [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/). Their experience
essentially inspired them on a mission to make [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) implementation
simple.

**Brendan** : So what does Chainstack do?

**Ashlie** : Chainstack is a multi-cloud and multi-protocol Platform as
a Service that empowers businesses to rapidly build, deploy, and manage
decentralized networks and services - think AWS for decentralized
applications. This makes it easy for users to create networks - of their
choice of protocol - that they use to build their decentralised
applications on top of.

Essentially what Chainstack is doing is that we're making it simple for
businesses to implement enterprise-grade decentralized solutions, so
that they can quickly progress from proof of concept to production on
their use cases.

**Brendan** : I'm a fan of the AWS analogy that you just used. In fact,
in the kickoff session for the DApps Dev Club, I used one myself -
calling out the similarities between invoking an EVM [smart contract](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/smart-contract-on-blockchain/)
function and invoking an AWS lambda function. So how does Chainstack's
platform help?

**Ashlie** : It's always very exciting to talk about the platform just
because of how powerful it is. We get people telling us that the
platform can accomplish in minutes what they've taken weeks to do,
without the hassle of hours or days of trial-and-error and
troubleshooting.

Chainstack is great because its solving many of the issues that have
made implementation difficult up till today, and this is based on
experience the co-founders have had while actually working with
[blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) themselves, and also having engaged with many people that are
doing the same - across industries and projects. Chainstack was born out
of the problems that many developers and enterprises face trying to
leverage off the benefits of decentralized technologies. We're very much
focused on making the complex simple.

There is a lot of demystifying that comes with working at a [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/)
startup. Blockchain has the potential to streamline a lot of processes
and industries, but these improvement don't have to be "revolutionary".
If anything, [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) is a technology that brings change that is
foundational more so than disruptive. In the past few months there have
been a couple of articles/ opinion pieces emerging that have alluded to
the notion that [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/)s will be boring in the future, because
technology that becomes normal always stops being interesting. And I
think it's funny because my co-founders often say this "we're not super
sexy - we're a really boring company solving very practical - but boring
problems."

**Brendan** : I actually do hope it becomes more boring too. I'd like
_[blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/)_ to become less of a marketing buzzword, and back to being
about the technology and applying it to solve a particular set of
problems. Where can we find more about Chainstack?

**Ashlie** : You can find out more about Chainstack at our [website](https://www.playgroundfx.com/blog/website-for-forex-trading/)
[chainstack.com][15], [@chainstackhq][22] on twitter, and
[medium.com/chainstack][23].

**Brendan** : Finally, let's wrap this up with the _vision_. What do you
see coming out of the collaboration between Chainstack and DApps Dev
Club?

**Ashlie** : Right now there are lots of issues that have impeded
[blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) adoption, one being its sheer complexity. We know that there
is heaps of interest in the technology, but many people just don't know
how or where to get started - even I've faced this. I was there for the
DApps Dev Club Kickoff, and I thought it was a great initiative because
it was extremely informative even though I don't have a technical
background. I think Chainstack and the DApps Dev Club are both aligned
in [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of wanting to make DLT more accessible. We're also on a mission
to make [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) implementation easy, so being exposed as much as
possible to how we can simplify this process is always going to help us
be better. We love the idea of a community, and we want to create an
environment that engages and supports people within the [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) space
and make it easy for people to enter.

**Brendan** : It is really great to hear that you enjoyed our first
session, and found it informative. I also love that you want to support
education in the space, as that's what we're about too!

**Ashlie** : We're also planning to roll out a series of podcasts
featuring people within the [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) space in the near future, so look
out for that!

**Brendan** : Will certainly do.

Once again, a big thanks to [Chainstack][15] for providing us with their
wonderful office space. We hope to see you all there at our [next
session][16]! In the meantime, [join the discussion][10].
