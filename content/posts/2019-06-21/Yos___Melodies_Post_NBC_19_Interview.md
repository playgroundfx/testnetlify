# Yos & Melodies Post-NBC'19 Interview

![][13]![][14]

 _Decentralised Patreon via Harberger taxes plus ERC721 non-fungible
tokens_

Yos Riady and Melodies Sim participated in the [NBC'19 Hackathon][15]
recently, and we caught up with them in the week after the event to ask
them about how it went for them.

Their [project is available on Github][16], and their [presentation is
available on Google Drive][17].

You can also [watch a demo video][18] of their project in action.

**Brendan** : Hi!

**Yos & Melodies**: Hello!

**Brendan** : You built the Crypto Collectibles project during the
hackathon … and won second place overall - congratulations! Tell us a
bit about your project.

**Yos** : Thank you! Our project is Patronage Collectibles, a protocol
that allows anyone to crowdfund on the [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/).

We believe crowdfunding today doesn't work because of high fees, unfair
curation, and most importantly: It's BORING. When you support someone,
you often only get a cold and impersonal thank you message.

**Brendan** : … and you have found a way to solve this, using [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/)
technologies, I understand.

**Yos** : Yes, crowdfunding doesn't have to be this way! What if you can
do it directly on the [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) using [smart contract](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/smart-contract-on-blockchain/)s in a
decentralized way? It would lower fees, be open to everyone, and become
more fun and gamified through crypto-collectibles!

With Patronage Collectibles, Creators can create and sell unique ERC721
crypto-collectibles to fund their work. Patrons can buy a Creator's
collectible to unlock exclusive content and other rewards. The catch is,
Owners of Patronage Collectibles have to pay a recurring pledge
(Harberger Tax) to the Creator in order to continue their ownership.
This gives Creators a recurring source of funding to continue their
creative endeavours.

When you support a Creator with Patronage Collectibles, you receive a
unique and personalized collectible on the [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) that gives you a
true feeling of ownership in your relationship with the Creator. It's
more fun, too!

(Editorial note: **ERC721** is an Ethereum standard for non-fungible
tokens.)

**Brendan** : So, specifically, your project made use of non-fungible
tokens, in combination with Harberger taxes. Could you briefly explain
what those [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) are for those who are new to them?

**Yos** : First of all, it's worth mentioning that the human instinct to
collect runs deep in our evolutionary [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/). Practically all human
cultures, even those that do not engage in substantial trade or that use
more modern forms of money, make and enjoy ornamental jewelry.
Historically, these physical collectibles had to be time-consuming to
create (a human proof-of-work) or it would've been easy for forgers to
create fakes.

**Non-Fungible Tokens** (NFTs) are the next step towards bringing
scarcity to the digital realm. NFTs are _digital collectibles_. They are
unique cryptographic tokens which are not interchangeable, in contrast
to currencies such as Bitcoin which are identical and _fungible_ in
nature. Cryptography and computational proof-of work ensures that each
NFT is real and verifiable. CryptoKitties were among the first NFTs.

Through NFTs, the [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) offers us a new model for digital
ownership. Digital assets can be registered as a 'token' and tracked on
a secure, immutable public ledger. You can preserve scarcity and verify
the chain of provenance for each token. Even as the asset gets passed
through multiple hands, its data remains immutable and intact. Each
transaction is also publicly viewable on the [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/), creating an
audit trail of the collectible's [history](https://www.fixpro.org/post/chargeless-historical-data-api-backtesting/).

**Harberger Taxes** is an economic [policy](https://www.fintechee.com/policy/) that recently gained
popularity due to the book, [Radical Markets][19]. We used this taxation
system to give Creators of Patronage Collectibles a recurring income
stream from their Patrons. You can think of Harberger Taxes as a
variation of the 'pay-what-you-want' model. Harberger Taxes works as
follows:

  * Owners of a Collectible freely sets the price of that Collectible.
  * Owners pay a % recurring pledge of the price to Creators.
  * Anyone can buy off a Collectible at its advertised price. Owners cannot refuse selling at that price.

This system incentivises Owners to set a low price to minimize the
amount taxes they have to pay. On the other hand, Owners are also
incentivised to set a price high enough to discourage others from buying
it away too readily. What ends up happening is you have to price a
Collectible at the value you are willing to pay to keep it.

**Melodies** : The idea of using Harberger taxes in personal
collectibles is also interesting as it creates a balancing act where
owners is incentivised to set the price of the collectible at the
owner's self-assessed value.

As Yos mentioned, owners cannot set a price too high or risk suffering
from high taxes or set the price too low and risk having the collectible
bought of. Consequently, owners have to set the price where he is feels
he is willing to pay a recurring tax to maintain ownership of the good.

This is unlike in traditional marketplace where the price is less
transparent as an owner often tend to set the price higher than he
values before asking for offers from interested buyers.

In this light, I believe that the Harberger taxes can bring about better
information and also more allocative efficiency in the marketplace as
now owners have an incentive to set the price more reasonably and closer
to the actual market assessed value of the good.

**Brendan** : To understand your project, and how it works under the
hood, looks like we'll all need to brush up on economics too!

On that note, what was most interesting to me about your project was
that you were able to design a novel new system of your own by
leveraging both technology - in this case, [smart contract](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/smart-contract-on-blockchain/)s - and
economic design. What are your thoughts on that?

**Yos** : I'm a huge believer that [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/)s offer much more than
cryptocurrencies. Let me elaborate on that in two parts.

First, economists have long dreamed about problems that could be solved
by market mechanisms. Through [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/)s, the laboratory of mechanism
design has been opened: By issuing a token and a few transparent rules
on a [smart contract](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/smart-contract-on-blockchain/) you are free to run your own cryptoeconomic
experiment.

**Brendan** : I'm digging that phrase, _the laboratory of mechanism
design_!

**Yos** : Well-designed protocols have the power to change the way
humans coordinate at scale. Let's look at the Ethereum cryptonetwork for
example. Nodes validate translations to profit from gas fees. While
pursuing their own self-interest, participants end up cooperating and
attaining a common, noble goal: A decentralized world computer.

Blockchain technology has created this emerging intersection of software
and economics that's opening up a whole new realm of possibilities on
how we can coordinate in a more trustless way.

Second, decentralized protocols are _composable_ and _permissionless_.
This is a huge enabler for innovation and empowerment for developers.

**Brendan** : How do composability and permissionlessness change the
game, so to speak?

**Yos** : So, startups today need to navigate a complex landscape of
walled garden ecosystems and platforms with huge proprietary data
advantages. Centralized platforms like Twitter can and have changed the
rules on developers and terminated great products.

With [smart contract](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/smart-contract-on-blockchain/)s, you don't have to ask for permission to build
something useful. New product ideas and technologies can be developed,
tested and iterated without being blocked by dominant platforms. I
believe this is a move in the right direction.

**Melodies** : I like how Yos described that through [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/), the
laboratory of mechanism design is opened. I absolutely agree with that.
The decentralised and transparent nature of [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) has unlocked many
more possibilities in [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of protocol designs. For instance,
decentralised file systems like IPFS, identity and reputation systems,
and even DAOs!

There are so much more to be explored! Just in the space of
cryptoeconomics, trustless and transparent nature of [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) provides
a platform to explore how we can reduce inefficiencies due to the lack
of perfect information in traditional markets.

(Editorial note: **DAO** stands for decentralised autonomous
organisation, and **IPFS** stands for inter-planetary file system.)

**Brendan** : Was that the idea that you originally started with, or did
you change things along the way?

**Yos** : The problem we wanted to solve had always been crowdfunding,
but the idea we originally started with was something quite different.

Our team's original idea was around 'personal cryptocurrencies.'
Creators would issue an ERC20 token that can be redeemed for work from
the Creator. It's like selling tokenized equity of yourself.

For example, let's say Alice is an illustrator and issues an ALC token.
Patrons would be able to buy these tokens from directly from a smart
contract and redeem it to request a piece of artwork from Alice. The
tokens would be issued by an Automated Market Maker and a Bonding Curve
ensures that prices are determined by market forces. The cryptoeconomic
model was pretty complex.

(Editorial note: **ERC20** refers to an Ethereum standard for fungible
tokens.)

**Melodies** : Yup, it was only during the hackathon when an innocent
suggestion to use robohash to generate unique cat images led us towards
pivoting towards personal crypto-collectibles not unlike cryptokitties.
In hindsight, it also makes the platform more fun and exciting to use!

**Yos** : I'm glad we decided to pivot because the new idea was both
simpler to implement and easier to explain.

**Brendan** : Do you intend to continue working on the project, now that
the hackathon is over?

**Melodies:** Yes, we're thinking of fleshing out the project and
sharing it with real users in the future, starting on a testnet. There's
a lot of work to be done before it's ready, though!

**Brendan** : That is awesome, I really do want to see a working version
of Patreon out there! Whether or not it is built atop a crypto-network,
I do still one to see one … but the fact that the one that you have made
here is fully _decentralised_ makes it that much _more appealing_ to me.
Be sure to ping me again when you launch!

Was there anything new that you learnt during the hackathon?

**Melodies** : I have learnt a lot from this hackathon especially
gaining a new respect for crytoeconomics. I have always had a
fascination for [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) and how much it can offer besides
cryptocurrencies. However, I never really thought much about the
different economic models [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) can emulate to reduce the current
inefficiencies in our traditional models.

I'm also pretty new to the [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/) space and have a lot to thank to
Yos for being patient and guiding throughout the hackathon.

I would say this hackathon has ignited a new passion in me to continue
learning and exploring [blockchain](https://www.letsplayfx.com/blog/trade-forex-with-bitcoin/)!

**Yos** : Personally, I learned a lot about pitching and presenting your
ideas across to others. It's not enough to just build something - you
have to _sell_ it too!

The hackathon also made me realize that the best ideas aren't developed
in isolation but out in the open. I am very thankful to Melodies and to
all the folks who dropped by our table and gave us feedback. Their
valuable inputs helped shape our idea in the right direction, making it
more approachable and easier to understand.

**Brendan** : That's great to hear, and I'm glad that you had a
conducive experience. My personal view is that hackathons are both about
competing and about learning, and there's always going to be a natural
tension between the two.

Did you attend any of the workshop events that were held in the lead up
to the hackathon?

**Yos** : No, unfortunately. I learned about the hackathon late and by
that time, most of the workshops had already ended.

**Melodies** : Unfortunately, it's the same for me!

**Brendan** : Fortunately, we have recorded some of the workshops, so
watch this space!

What did you think about the hackathon in general?

**Melodies** : NBC is my first hackathon and I was really impressed by
the welfare given - amount of food, snacks and goodies that was offered.
Those really supported me in my 2 days of hackathon.

**Yos** : I thought it was well organized and I'm a fan of the longer
session of 48 hours. Any shorter and we probably couldn't have shipped
on time.

**Brendan** : That in itself paints a very cool picture - for one of
you, it was a first time, and for the other you've been to a few - and
you teamed up, and built a cool project together - I like it!

What was your favourite part about the hackathon?

**Yos** : Pitching and demoing our project to the judges and audience.

**Melodies** : Designing and refining our product in [terms](https://www.fintechee.com/terms/) of the user-
usability was the most interesting part for me.

**Brendan** : Thank you very much for your time, and good luck with
launching this!

**Yos** : Thanks!

**Melodies** : Thanks!

* * *

We were quite excited to see all of the cool projects that were built
during the event, and hope that you continue building them.

For many participants, this event was not just about the competition,
but also about the learning.
